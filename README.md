# Eric Stavarache's take on Alex Palcuie's configs

Hacking like a geek:

* the `playbooks` folder contains Ansible that provisions a machine with apps and configs
* my main machine uses Debian.
* ZSH shell with Prezto and my .zshrc
* VIM provisioned with VimPlug

## Setup for new linux machine

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ericpts/dotfiles/master/setup.sh | bash
```
